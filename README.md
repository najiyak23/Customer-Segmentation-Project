# Project Background
This project aims to segment customers of an online retail business to improve marketing effectiveness. The company operates in the e-commerce industry and has been active for several years. Its business model involves selling a variety of products to individual customers. A key business metric for the company is customer lifetime value, which is directly influenced by customer engagement, retention, and purchase frequency. This project provides insights and recommendations on the following key areas:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying distinct customer groups based on purchase behavior.
- **High-Value Customer Engagement**: Strategies for retaining and maximizing revenue from top-tier customers.
- **Marketing Optimization**: Tailoring marketing efforts to specific customer segments.
- **Outlier Customer Behavior**: Understanding and addressing the behavior of unusual customer groups.
  
The Python code used to conduct this analysis, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building, can be found in the provided colab Notebook.[[Click here]](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GH2sdwuMneIPxsxrY2ZYpln4OZfEh9Q7?usp=sharing)

# Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
This project identified distinct customer segments based on their RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores. The analysis revealed a significant variation in customer behavior, with a small segment of high-value customers contributing a disproportionate share of revenue. Targeted marketing strategies are recommended to maximize customer lifetime value across different segments.
Where to add image: [Visualization, including a graph of RFM scores or a snapshot of a customer segmentation dashboard would be included here.] You can add a plot here showing overall RFM distribution or perhaps a visual representation of the clusters
